<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This lomo saltado recipe is a traditional and very easy dish to make. I might add that it's also very popular with finicky kids and adults.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frozen French Fries</li>
<li>Beef strips</li>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Soy Sauce</li>
<li>Rice</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cook the french fries in a pan or an oven. Peruvians make them in the pan.</li>
<li>Season the beef and cook it.</li>
<li>Add the sliced tomatoes and some soy sauce. Cook until it's tender.</li>
<li>I hope by now that you cooked the rice as well.</li>
<li>Serve a side of rice (cooked) and the beef+tomatoes stir mixed with some french fries. You have to mix the fries with the beef for a true peruvian presentation.</li>
<li>Add some parsley on top, if you have parsley.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can eat this with an Inca Kola or a cold beer. Maybe even with a Pisco Sour.</p>
